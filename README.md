# FFF
Firefox are going worse since they introducing WebExtension and making up that sexy Australis look for being like an Edge's doppleganger including those boxy ugly tabs. I don't like the Photon UI at all so i made this. This is **unfinished** UI rework and looks bit weird on FF58 higher - i don't care.

# UI Changes

+ Borderless
+ Curvy tabs are back! (credit: wilfredwee)
+ Forward & back button classic look
+ Circular button box
+ Close tab button available on hover
+ Audio tab icon are left-aligned
+ Horizontally-aligned icon-only Addon lists
+ Removed some unnesecessary menu entries
+ Floating minimal scrollbar

# Usage
This only optimally work on Firefox 57++
1. Arrange your Firefox interface layout (Menu > Customize...) to look like this, more or less: **

![layout](https://i.imgur.com/6Pid1GD.png)

2. Type `about:support` in the URL bar.
3. Click Open Folder on Profile Folder section.
4. Look for `chrome` folder, if that folder doesn't exist, create it.
5. Download `UserChrome.css` from this page, and place it to that `chrome` folder.***
6. Restart Firefox.

_** Make sure these layout are in the **exact following order**: back - forward - urlbar - refresh  
*** Also grab `userchrome.xml` & `scrollbar` if you want the custom scrollbar look_
